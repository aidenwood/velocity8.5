              Unless your digital marketing agency is creative atleast a few new ad creatives every week for your brand, then you're simply getting ripped off. We apply more creative and targeting testing than most do by far, but that is absolutely how you compete in the fast moving world of digital marketing. Otherwise your money is simply being spent for empty results to show you.
